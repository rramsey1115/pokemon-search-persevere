# Pokemon Search Project

This project was used in the Persevere coding class, as a group project. 
Since the students do not have access to external web connections for the required API, we did this as a group project while I shared my screen.
This project is taken from the FreeCodeCamp Javascript curriculum.

Teacher: Ryan Ramsey
Facility: Trousdale Turner Correctional Facility
